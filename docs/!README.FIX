0.8u1
------
NT/95:  Fixed a bug in nt/TcpErr.c. We show correct information about
	errors now.

0.8u2
------
NT/95:  The "reference" compiler changed. NT & W95 versions are compiled
	with MSVC now. Watcom C is not supported any more.
	Cosmetic changes to compile binkd with MSVC without warnings.
	Known bug: binkd exits incorrectly with ctrl-c/ctrl-break

0.8.5
-----
	Binkd used to close unsecure sessions only by timeout, fixed

	readcfg.c rewritten

	FTN_DOMAIN and FTN_NODE moved to ftndom.h, ftndom.c, ftnnode.h,
	ftnnode.c

	Now one can specify an alternative port for a node in config.file:
		#
		node 5047/13 hostname.domain:altport -

	Fixed "bind: Address already in use"

	Now we define and use INVALID_SOCKET and SOCKET_ERROR instead of -1
	for WINSOCK compatibility

	Logfile is opened just before writing and closed right after that
	
	readdir.h -- The header to get POSIX directory interface out of
	misc compilers

	Now binkd removes partial .pkt's (Next time it creates
	a new temporary name in the inbound dir)

	When trying to receive a new file: remove partial files with this name
	but different size or time from the inbound. (By default binkd
	will left old parts as .dt and .hr in the inbound directory)
		#
		kill-dup-partial-files
			
	Remove all old partial files from the inbound. (OFF by default)
		#
		kill-old-partial-files <max-age-in-seconds>

NT/95:  ctrl-c problems fixed

	Fixed a bug in protocol.c

	Show percents while sending or receiving
		#
		percents

0.8.6
-----
	Fixed a minor bug in protocol.c (Some error msgs were not sent
	to the remote)

	Fixed "restoring poll with 'h' flavour" bug

	Added .csy support (A la T-Mail)

	Added more .?sy checks so binkd will not try to start a client
	to call a busy node

	Changed password checking a bit

	New keyword:
		#
		minfree <Kbytes>
	binkd will skip all files from a node if the size of the next file
	for us there + minfree < free space in inbound
	Default -- don't check

	Flags, like this
		#
		flag D:\\bbs\\flags\\toss!.now *.pkt
		flag D:\\bbs\\flags\\toss!.now *.su? *.mo? *.tu? *.we? *.th? *.fr? *.sa?

	Misc bugs were fixed by Mike Malakhov

0.8.7
-----
	Added minfree-nonsecure (see minfree). There is a good idea to set
	them both if you have both of your inbounds on the same file system.
		#
		minfree-nonsecure <Kbytes>

	Minor fixes

0.8.8
-----
	Extended the syntax of the Flag statement:
		#
		flag [!]path wildcard ...
	`!' before the pathname stands for "immediate" flag

	Binkd has become a really quiet thing. Use
		#
		printq
	keyword to make	queue rescans verbose, and
		#
		conlog <loglevel>
	if you want binkd's log at your console.

	New keywords:
		#
		try <N>
		hold <S>
	binkd will try to call a node N times, if failed, it will
	hold the node for S seconds. The feature is off by default.

	Support for .try/.hld a la Brake Mailer g710+
	
	Added more paranoya to inbound.c

	client.c/ftnq.c was rewritten

	Improved SIGCHLD handling, please use -DSYS5SIGNALS / -DEMXSIGNALS for
	SysV / EMX signal models, see reapchld.inc

	Added some experimental code, which will theoretically help to
	avoid some bugs

	Added "include" keyword:
		#
		include filename
	
*IX:    SIGHUP forces binkd to restart

	New keyword:
		#	
		hold-skipped <S>
	Binkd will hold all mail, skipped by a node, for S seconds.
	(Def. -- 3600)

	Extended the syntax of the Node statement:
		#
		node [[z:]n/]n[.p] [{host[:port]|-} [{pwd|-} [flavour [{obox|-} [{ibox|-}]]]]]
	Flavour is one of i, c, d, -, h; and is the flavour for the outbound
	filebox. All non-"-" fields will redefine values specified for the
	same node earlier in config. Default for ibox is inbound or
        inbound-nonsecure depending on the pwd field. Default for port is oport.
	Binkd sends from obox all non-dir entries NOT matching ".*" wildcard.
	EVERY TIME YOU PUT A FILE INTO OBOX CHECK IF BINKD WILL BE ABLE TO
	UNLINK IT. Otherwise, the session will never end.


0.9     (Fri May  9 15:56:43 GSD 1997)
---
	Perform reverse resolving (logging only)
		#
		backresolv

	Log pid:
		#
		pid-file /var/run/binkd.pid

	Sometimes binkd reported "secure session" but used non-secure inbound

	Binkd could not rename files with `#' in their names after receiving
	(Reported by Andrew Sukhorukov)
	
	Some minor bugs fixed

	Added command line options:
		-i	run from inetd (OS/2 or *IX only)
			(*IX: don't forget to turn `printq', `conlog' and
			`percents' OFF when running from inetd -- binkd will
			not take care about this itself!!!)
		-c	start clientmgr only
		-p	start clientmgr only, make polls, quit if the queue
			seems to be empty after the next rescan
		-s	start servmgr only
	
	Changes based on the patch by Boris Tobotras --
	1) you can now use service names (as in /etc/services) with iport/oport
	2) before using 24554 as the default port number, binkd will try
	to find "binkp" entry in /etc/services database first

	Binkd/0.8.5+ used to lose netmail under UNIXs sometimes and
	left .pkt's as .dt under OS/2, NT, etc. :-( Fixed. (Many reports)

	Added syslog support -- to use it you need to make binkd with
	HAVE_VSYSLOG defined and add syslog facility name to config:
		#
		syslog local0
	(Based on the patch by Boris Tobotras)

	Binkd could create a poll in *.olo instead of *.flo (Reported
	by Dmitry Baronov and John Gladkih)

	Now binkd will touch it's *.bsy's aprox. every 60 seconds.
	(Binkd changes *.bsy's m- and atimes only!)

	Extended the syntax of the Node statement:
		#
		node [[z:]n/]n[.p] [-nr] [{host[:port]|-} [{pwd|-} [flavour [{obox|-} [{ibox|-}]]]]]
        `-nr' stands for `Not Reliable Link', this works only on outbound calls
	with another binkp/1.1 mailer. The option solves the only problem with
	binkd having not enough time to start receiving a file from
	non-zero offset before the IP link is down, so don't use it unless you
	have this problem -- really not effective

	Map paths in flo's:
		#
		ftrans old-string new-string
	eg,
		#
		ftrans "D:\\fido\\outbound" "/var/spool/fido/outb"
		ftrans "\\" "/" # this replaces all slashes in a path
	Use as many ftrans's as you want.

	New keyword:	
		#
		exec command wildcard ...
	Binkd will run the command if one of wildcards matches a rcvd file.
	*S in the command line will expand in a full path for a S.R.I.F file,
	see !SRIF.TXT for details, eg.
		#
		exec "my-freq-processor.exe /options *S" *.req
	(Not really tested)

	Fixed hang-ups in EMX version. May be. (John Gladkih)


0.9.1   (Mon Jun 16 17:37:04 GSD 1997)
-----
*IX:	Configure script. (see !README)

	Binkd could not correctly ACK receiving of files with some names
	(Reported by John Gladkih)

	Binkd ignored fileboxes' flavours (Reported by Sergey Gubanov)

	Changed pid-file handling a bit.

	Binkd will not complain about missing .rsp files when running
	programms with "exec" statement without using of *S macro.

	Binary log in T-Mail format:
		#
		binlog o:\\log\\binkd.sts
		tzoff 10800                # correct UTC time returned
					   # by time() under DOS-derived OS
	(By Fyodor Ustinov)

	Binkd didn't strip disk labels (Reported by Fausto de Carvalho)

	Command line option `-C': exit(3) on config change -- checked on
	every incoming connection. (EMX BUG: binkd will not quit until all
	active connections are closed)

	Session would never end if remote skips files being sent
	from our outbound filebox.

	New keyword:	
		#
		send-if-pwd
	Don't send (only receive) files if no password for an inbound session.

	Remove old .bsy/.csy files (If some are left after a system crash).	
		#
		kill-old-bsy <max-age-in-seconds>
	It would be wise to set this to 43200 (12 hrs) on almost any system.
	(Note that binkd always touches it's .bsy's/.csy's for active sessions;
	kill-old-bsy is OFF by default)

0.9.2   (Fri Nov  7 16:17:59 GSK 1997)
-----
	FronDoor- and Bink/+-style binary history (by maxb)
		#
		fdinhist in.his
		fdouthist out.his

	Amiga port by Dmitry Yurtaev <dmitry@relay.channel4.mplik.ru>

	You can now specify a list of internet addresses for a node:
		#
		node 999 Host-1;Host-2:333;Host-3

	Some minor patches.

	Binkd used to remove pidfiles not in time (Sergey Babitch)

	Binkd will do 1:2/3.4 --> p4.f3.n2.z1.fidonet.net translation
	automatically if you specify `*' as the hostname for a node:
		#
		node 999 *
	(Yes, you can say "node 999 fido.xxx.ru;*")

	Use `root-domain' keyword to change the root domain default for
	1:2/3.4 --> p4.f3.n2.z1 lookups:
		#
		root-domain fidonet.org.

	Providing a password on incoming call on UNSECURE link (i.e. no
	password for them in our cfg, but they send us a password)
	isn't an authentication error anymore (It's not a pwd-protected
	link either).

	Binkd now handles correctly files made by Bink/+'s arcshield.
	(patch by Pavel Gulchouck <gul@lucky.carrier.kiev.ua>)

0.9.3   (Wed Mar 29 10:33:34 EDT 2000)
-----
	When renaming a duplicate inbound file, for *.pkt and *.?ic (tic,
	zic, etc.) change the filename but not the extension.
	(patch by Pavel Gulchouck <gul@lucky.carrier.kiev.ua>)

	Ditto for arcmail.

	Always log remote's IP-address in dotted-decimal notation, even
	if `backresolv' is on.

	Changes to support spaces in filenames being sent via binkp: spaces
	and other control characters are converted to C-style \xHH form by
	sender and back by receiver (H -- is a hex digit, case insensitive).

	New command line key `-P': poll a node. For example,
		   $ binkd binkd.cfg -P .1
	will add a data record for your first point in binkd's core (if
	needed) and then create a corresponding *.ilo in the outbound.

	Binkd used to send _all_ log messages to syslogd, relying on it's
	ability to ignore redundant (per `syslog.conf') data. Now it
	will only send messages allowed by value of the `loglevel' config
	variable, thus reducing network traffic and increasing Binkd's
	syslog support flexibility.

	Fixed a minor bug in `node' config statement parsing.

*IX:    Changed code for renaming of files, now should work on FAT, SMBFS,
	etc.

	Now binkd will sort files from fileboxes before sending -- by type
	(first *.pkt's, then arcmail, other files, last *.?ic's) and then by
	file time (new files last).

	`Oport' configuration keyword was broken.

	If Binkd could not open a T-Mail-style history file once it never
	tried to open it again.

	Option "-nd" in "node" string in binkd.cfg - "No Dupe Mode"
	on outbound link with another binkd 0.9.3. It protects for
	making duplicate files while link losses, but makes link a
	bit slower.

	New options "filebox", "brakebox" and "deletebox" in binkd.cfg -
	support of t-mail and TheBrake! fileboxes.

	New option "prescan" in binkd.cfg - rescan outbound for
	node and send traffic prognose on session start (compartible
	with argus).

	OS/2 emx version restarts itself when config is changed and
	command line option "-C" is specified.

	OS/2 wcc version - "Too many open files" bug fixed.

	OS/2 & win32 versions: bsy-files are kept opened while
	session is active (to protect from removing).

	ACK is sent only when file has been successfully renamed
	in inbound to its realname (otherwise session drops).
	"The file is complete, but not renamed to it's realname,
	so I'll not remove it!" removed, now it's safe to delete
	all old .hr and .dt files in inbound.

0.9.4   (Fri Jul 07 09:54:00 EET 2000)
-----
	Win32 code cleanup (Dima Afanasiev <da@4u.net>).

	Don't attempt to kill client manager if it's not running
	(Michail Vidiassov <master@iaas.msu.ru>).

	Fixed bug in multithread version (win32 & os2/watcom).

	New option "temp-inbound" in binkd.cfg - directory for the
	incomplete files (.dt and .hr) being received.

	New options "socks" and "proxy" in binkd.cfg
	(Dima Afanasiev <da@4u.net>)

	MD5 authorization (Dima Afanasiev <da@4u.net>)
	New commandline switch "-m" - disable MD5 authorization.

	prescan did not work on incoming sessions with send-if-pwd

	NT: new command line parameters "-i" (install as service)
	and "-u" (uninstall service) (Dima Afanasiev <da@4u.net>)

	Immediate events (beginning with '!') run immediately
	after receiving a file (Dima Afanasiev <da@4u.net>)

	Macros *F (file name), *H (host name), *A0..*A9
	(remote addresses), *L (listed), *P (protected)
	in events (Dima Afanasiev <da@4u.net>)

	Option "-ip" in "node" string in binkd.cfg - "Restrict
	remote IP-address". If specified incoming connections
	for this node are allowed only from one of the node's hosts.

	Prescan did not add size of files in fileboxes.

	Send "NUL TIME" in RFC format.

	NT: MessageBox if service ended with error (Dima Afanasiev
	<da@4u.net>).

	New option "connect-timeout" in binkd.cfg - timeout
	for connect() in seconds. 0 - no check. Doesn't work
	in multithreaded versions. Recommended for linux.

	New option "passwords" in binkd.cfg - name of file
	contains passwords in t-mail format  (Dima Afanasiev
	<da@4u.net>).

	New option "defnode" in binkd.cfg - default node
	flags, now binkd can call an unlisted node from fidonet.net domain
	(Dima Afanasiev <da@4u.net>).

	SIGHUP handler fixed (sometimes binkd/unix exited
	instead	of restart).

	-C did not work with -c (client only).

	binkd -C now checks included config-files.

	binkd -c did not handle SIGHUP (unix).

	binkd -C now restarts itself if config changed (unix).

	binkd/2 EMX now restarts itself by SIGHUP.

	Some protocol bugs are fixed (skipping files in NR- or ND-mode
	caused waiting for session timeout).

	configure sometimes added redundant libraries.

	binkd/2 Watcom did not set modification time of received
	files.

	New options "-md" (require md5 authorization) and
	"-nomd" (disable md5 on outgoing calls) in "node" line
	(Dima Afanasiev <da@4u.net>)

0.9.5	(Thu Sep 04 2003 18:18:04)
-----
	64-bit integer fix (Tobias Ernst 2:2476/418).

	Allow '-' and '_' in domain names (Tobias Ernst 2:2476/418).

	"defnode" did not work correctly in 0.9.4.

	be specified, resolved and matched. For -ip option an unresolved
	host is ok.

	Crypt traffic, new option -r (disable crypt).

	NR- and ND-modes can be asymmetric now, options -nr and -nd
	set mode only for receiving files from this node.

	Version for DOS (ported by Victor Pashkevich, 2:451/30@fidonet)

1.0.0	(Thu Jun 21 2012 08:55:22)
-----
	New config option "share" - shared aka definition
	(patch from Igor Krassikov 2:463/59).

	New config option check-pkthdr, link options -hc, -nohc -
	check pkt src addr (val khokhlov <val@vk.kiev.ua>).

	Perl hooks (val khokhlov <val@vk.kiev.ua>).

	Bugfix: do not transmit negative value of file time in binkp commands
	and check file time in received frames (Stas Degteff <g@ural.org>).

	New config option "nolog" - inhibit specified log messages
	(val khokhlov <val@vk.kiev.ua>).

	New option -t operates with NT and w9x service (start, stop,
	query status, install, uninstall).

	Icons and binary descriptions for 32 bit windows versions
	(Icon autor: Tany Bobrova <pushinda@grumbler.org>).

	'skipmask' is replaced with 'skip', which allows more skipping
	features and has another format (val khokhlov <val@vk.kiev.ua>).

	New config parameters zlib-dll and bzlib2-dll for win32 versions
	compiled with ZLIBDL support.

	New optional parameter root-domain for 'domain' config option.

	New config option dont-send-empty - inhibit sending empty
	(zero-size) files.

	Fixed bug in sending partial files without NR- or ND-mode.

	Build using MS Visual C: Perl*.dll not required now at run-time,
	this dll is loaded only if needed.
	Default root-domain fidonet.net changed to binkp.net.

	Add IPv6 support - default if building system supports RFC2553
	API, except under Win32 where it needs to be enabled explicitly
	(set IPV6=1 during make). Under Win32 at least WinXP SP2 is
	required. Outbound IPv4 or IPv6 usage can be limited by using
	-4 or -6 node parameters respectively.

	Add FSP-1035 (IN SRV DNS records) support. Currently only Unix
